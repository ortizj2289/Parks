            <p class="content">Erwin Park is one of the newer parks to me. Now that I live on the opposite 
                side of McKinney, I've been taking advantage of what Erwin Park has to offer. You can find more information <a href="https://www.mckinneytexas.org/885/Erwin-Park">HERE.</a></p>

                <p class="content">Erwin Park has some unique ammenities not available anywhere else. 
                If you are a fan of camping, this park is for you. I have not personally taken 
                advantage of this feature but I do go on the occasional hike there and I have seen 
                the numerous camping spots available. If you want to spend a weekend in a tent but 
                not want to deal with complete isolation, you should definitely give this a try. You 
                would only be 15 minutes away from the nearest Walmart.

                <p class="content">
                    Erwin Park seems to be the most "outdoorsy" to me with its long hiking 
                    trails that can be over 8 miles long, and abundant wildlife. It has 
                    a bicycle trail for the cycling enthusiasts, not available anywhere else.
                    I think it has less available than other parks but because of its size, 
                    its easy to spend alot of time here exploring nature. Because of its simplicity 
                    and size, I give Erwin Park 4 out of 5 stars!
