            <p class="content">Finch Park is a hidden gem amongst our many public parks. 
                It is also relatively old and has seen its fair share of changes. 
                Its signature feature includes a splash pad where residents can 
                cool off during those hot Texas summers.  For a full list of ammenities, click

                <p class="content">Growing up around downtown McKinney, I spent many summers 
                playing in the creek that goes through Finch Park. Being so close to the woods, 
                this was a great location to catch fireflies and crayfish from the creek.

                <p class="content">
                    Finch Park definitely has a unique quality where if you did not grow 
                    up around it, it does not stand out much. For it's small size though, 
                    it does offer alot and this was one of the few McKinney parks that offered 
                    tennis courts. With all of these things in mind, I give Finch Park 
                    3 out of 5 stars!
